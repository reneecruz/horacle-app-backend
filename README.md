## What on Earth is **The Horacle**? 

**The Horacle** is your friendly, interactive horoscope oracle guide for daily advice that you co-create! Upon your request, **The Horacle** magically generates a random Mablib that's just for you.  Then, you get to use your free will to choose which noun, verb and adjective to fit into your future and create your very own prediction, Mad Libs style!  **The Horacle** horoscope oracle is your own free will meets astrological fun! 

And if you're in the mood for a more traditional Astrology Daily Horoscope, scroll down to find a daily horoscope for your Sun Sign using data from Astrology and Horoscope API.  Make it a great day with some fun, irreverent and (probably!) grammatically incorrect guidance from your friend, **The Horacle**!
